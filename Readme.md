Writing a Simple Selenium Test

We will provide an example test project you can use in order to quickly simulate the Selenium grid usage. Later you can apply the configuration to your own repository and run Grid from there. Here are the steps.

Pre-requisites are:
We need to download and install Java Development Kit (JDK).
We need to have an IDE installed. (Eclipse, IntelliJ etc.) 

Pull this github repository for your example test project in Java. 
Open terminal window and navigate to this directory
Run following command
Unix-based systems: 
./gradlew clean test
Windows systems
gradlew.bat clean test

As a result you will have:
Gradle automatically installed. 
Test code and project automatically setup.
Your example test will run once.
You can now open your project from your favorite IDE. Please see links for importing your project. For Eclipse:

For IntelliJ Idea: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/importing-project-from-gradle-model.html
